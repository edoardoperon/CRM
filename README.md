# Project 1: Segment Analysis through SQL

# Overview
In this project, I designed and created a database similar to what a simplified corporate ERP might be. I wanted to segment customers by distribution channel and extrapolate business data.

With this project I wanted to demonstrate my ability to:

Understand the logic of a database
- Use basic and intermediate commands to extract data from a database
- The tool I used for the project is PostgresSQL and Excel.

# Objectives of the project

The two main goals I wanted to bring home with this project were:
- create a structured database like what a corporate ERP can be
- solve real questions that may be in an enterprise

More specifically, the database and the queries I have created should segment customers and report margins by customer, distribution channel and single product.
