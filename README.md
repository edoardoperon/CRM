# Project 1: Segment Analysis through SQL

# Overview
In this project, I designed and created a database similar to what a simplified corporate ERP might be. I wanted to segment customers by distribution channel and extrapolate business data.

With this project I wanted to demonstrate my ability to:
- Understand the logic of a database
- Use basic and intermediate commands to extract data from a database

The tools I used for the project are PostgresSQL and Excel.

# Objectives of the project

The two main goals I wanted to bring home with this project were:
- Create a structured database like what a corporate ERP can be
- Solve real questions that may be in an enterprise

More specifically, the database and the queries I have created should segment customers and report margins by customer, distribution channel and single product.

# Phases of the project

  ## 1. Thinking about the infostructure 

  ## 2. Create tables

  ## 3. Importing the data through csv file 

  ## 4. Thinking about business questions

  ## 5. Create view for each answer

# Code
